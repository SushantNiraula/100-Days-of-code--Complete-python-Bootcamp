## I need to understand how the game works. What is the game mechanics. How to make it work.

**Blackjack** (also known as **21**) is a popular card game typically played in casinos between a player and a dealer. The objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value **closer to 21** without **going over**.

### üî¢ Basic Rules

- **Card Values**:
  - Number cards (2‚Äì10): face value
  - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): 10
  - Aces: 1 or 11 (whichever benefits the hand more)

- **Goal**: Get a hand value as close to **21** as possible without exceeding it.

- **Blackjack**: An Ace + 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, King) on the first two cards is called a "Blackjack" and usually **pays 3:2**.

### üÉè How a Round Works

1. **Initial Deal**:
   - Player and dealer each get **2 cards**.
   - Player's cards are face up. Dealer shows **1 card face up**, the other face down.

2. **Player's Turn**:
   - **Hit**: Take another card.
   - **Stand**: Keep current hand.
   - **Double Down**: Double your bet, take one more card, then stand.
   - **Split**: If dealt two of the same value, split into two hands (requires a second bet).
   - **Surrender** (in some games): Give up half your bet and end your hand.

3. **Dealer's Turn**:
   - Dealer reveals their hidden card.
   - Dealer **must hit until reaching 17 or more** (some games use soft 17 rules).

4. **Winning Conditions**:
   - Player busts (goes over 21): You lose.
   - Dealer busts: You win.
   - Higher hand wins if neither busts.
   - Tie = "Push": You get your bet back.

### üí∞ Payouts

- **Blackjack**: 3:2
- **Win**: 1:1
- **Insurance** (if dealer shows Ace): Pays 2:1, but statistically a bad bet
